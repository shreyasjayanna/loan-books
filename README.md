## Setting up environment
To build and run this code, [install Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.15 or higher

## Running the code
1. Clone this repo locally
2. Run `go run main.go` from the base level of the repo after installing Golang
3. The result assignments.csv and yields.csv files are created in `data/results` folder. Make sure results folder exists before running the code.

### Note
Due to time crunch, I'm unable to complete tests and hence chose not to include incomplete test suite. However, the solution has been verified to match the result from the small dataset.
